## Credits

----

This workshop was based on some of the [teaching material](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/teaching-material)
of [Ferrous Systems](https://ferrous-systems.com)

----

Some examples, snippets and exercises  
were inspired by places like:

- the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) exercises
- the [Rust track on exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/rust)

We only scratched the surface.

There is a lot more to learn,  
but now you know the basics!
